I am a M.S. Computer Science student at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. I am focusing on Machine learning and finding projects that do social good. 

I am excited to be joining Amazon this summer as a SDE Intern in the Seattle/Bellevue location and will return to Brooklyn in Fall 2021 to continue my M.S. program.


Some things I am thinking about are:
------
1. Thing 1
1. Thing 2
1. Thing 3
