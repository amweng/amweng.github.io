I am a M.S. Computer Science student at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. I am focusing on Machine learning and working on finding projects that do social good. 

I am excited to be joining Amazon this summer as a SDE Intern in Seattle and will return to Brooklyn in Fall 2021 to continue my M.S.


Some things I am thinking about right now are:
------
1. Visualization for Machine Learning (CS-GY 9223)
1. Brainstorming project ideas for HackPrinceton
1. Looking for a subletter for my Brooklyn studio (contact me if interested)
